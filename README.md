You can think of it as a technique where a tree is branched out from the top to the branches. In short, it's like a branching example. For instance, let's say you're ordering chicken. Chicken is the top class. The subclass is the choice between mushroom chicken or onion chicken. For example, you chose onion chicken; now, which size of onion do you want? It is organized in a hierarchical structure like this, with classes arranged one under another. It has a structure similar to a parent-child relationship.
